## What is this

An implementation of [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) for Umbraco using [GraphQL for .NET](https://github.com/graphql-dotnet/graphql-dotnet).

Please note this **should not be used in production**, since there are **no security** and all you data will be **publicly available**.

## How does it work

GraphQL types are dynamically generated for all Umbraco document types (content and media), with all the properties as fields.

## Installation
